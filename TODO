Publisher:
   • If a message is added to a topic, broadcast that message to subscribers of the list other than sender
   • Only clients subscribed to a topic can publish to said topic

Subscriber:
   • Have a 2nd thread which listens and outputs messsages received through UDP
   • Create and bind to an available (unique) UDP port which is sent to Publisher when registering

Both:
   • Modify function names and parameter syntax to:
        • REGISTER: REGISTER <username> <client-host> <UDP port>
        • LIST TOPICS: LIST TOPICS
        • LIST USERS: LIST USERS
        • CREATE TOPIC: CREATE TOPIC <topic_name>
        • SUBSCRIBE: SUB <topic_name>
        • PUBLISH: PUB <topic_name> <message>
        • GET DM INFO: GET-DM-INFO <username> # client program will send this to the server when the
        next command is processed
        • DM USER: DM <username> <message>

Would-be Nice Features:
    • Unique usernames for registration
    • Users shouldn't be able to subscribe to topics that don't exist
        • Server sends error message

Brushup
    • Modify the list users output so all users are on 1 line
